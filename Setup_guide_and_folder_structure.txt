Hello, thank you for the opportunity to participate in your internship
Program.

Unfortunately I had only one day to do this task, so the result is not satisfying for me,
but I decided to send you what I have created and try to not miss the chance for this
opportunity.

The initialization of the project is very easy.
It contains a mock data base in the mock-db folder.
You just need to install the json-server: npm i json-server
and npm init the package.json (it contains everything inside),
then start the json server with the command: json-server --watch db.json --port 8000
I suggest port 8000 since, the frontend part of the project is using react.js
which default port runs on 3000

The second part is to navigate to cd my-app, where you should also npm init to
install all of the node_modules.
Then just use the command 'npm start' and the app should start on localhost:3000 by default

Now regarding the front-end architecture.
It is very simple, I decided to have a main dashboard, which holds the states for
both dashboards (employees and tasks).

Each dashboard takes the state for it (either employees or tasks) and renders
everything from the Database

Each item has its own buttons for alteration and the handlers are passed to the 
most upper component that holds the state and handles the functions (edit, del)

In each dashboard we have a link to create either a task or employee.
From the main app component we use the route to navigate to each
creation page.

I understand that the components could be separated in 2 folders 
(1 folder for employee components and another folder for task components), 
but unfortunately I had no time to do that.

If given more time I could add the missing tasks and adjust the components 
in diffent folders as they should be.

Thank you for your time.
